1. data exploration
   create visualization use seaborn library
   use 3D and lots of colors where possible
   plot a few plots in each row
   plot many plots
   visualization might need to be stored in a different location since
     files will be large

2a. readme.MD
2b. wiki page
2c. organize git repo so it makes sense for external visitors

3. looper to run all data
   need to report any problems
   create plots
   create tables
   make sure memory is not increasing too much as you run so that all items can be
      calculated

4. Prophet single run function
   create a function that can predict Nov 2015 given a dataframe in a certain format
   needs to be in the form of a function
   use the agreed upon setting for Prophet and pre-processing

5. Cleaning data
   remove outliers, negative cnt items, find bad data
   - if items have only two months of data we need to predict 0 or remove them (item 9242)
   - items don't have any data for 3 or 4 months before Nov 2015 we might want to exclude
     them?
   - item 4249 has error when running:
     "WARNING:fbprophet:Optimization terminated abnormally. Falling back to Newton."
   - work with person doing 3 and 4

6. Performance Analysis (Error)
   use 1/3 of data as a "test" set and compare our model in 4) with that data
   could compare with other models in task 7

7. Alternative model discussions
   - Neural Networks and LSTM
   - ARIMA
   - k-means clustering

1. data exploration  (Bhargav)
   create visualization use seaborn library
   use 3D and lots of colors where possible
   plot a few plots in each row
   plot many plots
   visualization might need to be stored in a different location since
     files will be large

2a. readme.MD  (Mike)
2b. organize git repo so it makes sense for external visitors
    folders:
       data
       exploration
       tools
       prophet
       lstm
       
3a. Prophet looper to run all data (Mike)
3b. LSTM Looper  (Abdullah)
   need to report any problems
   create plots
   create tables
   make sure memory is not increasing too much as you run so that all items can be
      calculated

4a. Prophet single run function  (Claire)
   create a function that can predict Nov 2015 given a dataframe in a certain format
   needs to be in the form of a function
   use the agreed upon setting for Prophet and pre-processing

4b.  LSTM Method (Bhargav)

5. Cleaning data (Claire)
   remove outliers, negative cnt items, find bad data
   - if items have only two months of data we need to predict 0 or remove them (item 9242)
   - items don't have any data for 3 or 4 months before Nov 2015 we might want to exclude
     them?
   - item 4249 has error when running:
     "WARNING:fbprophet:Optimization terminated abnormally. Falling back to Newton."
   - work with person doing 3 and 4

6. Performance Analysis RMSE (Christian)
   use 1/3 of data as a "test" set and compare our model in 4) with that data
   could compare with other models in task 7
